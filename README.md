# Quadratic Voting

This is a simple library to implement a quadratic voting library. Quadratic voting weights the reserve token amount required to cast a vote for a given proposal on a quadratic scale. 

This library is modeled after the Substrate framework. Its purpose is to mimic the setup and implementations as they are setup in Substrate and experiment with Rust's intrinsic features such as traits and generics.
